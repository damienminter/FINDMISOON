      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>I was found on the ground of Banyawol RR Station in Daegu on November 13, 1971. Within a day, I was brought to the Il Shim Won Babies Home. The next day I was put into foster care. It was estimated that I was born in 1969 and that my age was 2.5 years old or less. I did not speak so I could not say my name or any details about me. I stayed in foster care until I was flown to the United States on October 4, 1972 to be adopted.</p>
      <div class="d-none" id="myStory">
        <p>I was adopted into a very loving, strict Christian household, made up of my father (teacher), mother (nurse) and five siblings that are biological to my parents. I have two older sisters, two older brothers and one brother who is only three months younger than me. Because my father was a teacher, he always took the opportunity to teach us and we got to help with the grading of his students' work. We spent many summers together as a family, visiting national parks all over the US, traveling to 49 states in a motorhome, learning crafts at camping conventions, hiking, swimming, cooking, sewing, learning and playing. My family never once made me feel like I was adopted. My parents taught us about family and hard work. We shoveled, raked, mowed lawns and cleaned houses of the elderly friends and family. I was very fortunate to be adopted into this family. They are irreplaceable.</p>
        <p>I have no memories at all of Korea. I don't know what my given name or birthdate are. There is a story my mom has though. When I flew over from Korea, there was a baby on the plane that I took a liking to. So a picture was taken of us at the airport. That picture stayed on the piano for years. When I was 10 years old, my mom was upset at me for something. My response to her was, "Are you going to give me away like you gave my sister away." I do not remember this outburst. But my mom says that exclamation explains some things about how I acted up to that point. Needless to say, she got rid of that picture off the piano.</p>
        <p>I am already 51 years of age and I have always wanted to know who my parents are and I have dreams of meeting them. When I was a child and I was upset with my family, I would say, "I'm going to Korea to look for my real family." I remember once sitting in the car, as if someone was going to bring me to the airport that minute. I was always very proud that I am Korean.</p>
        <p>Last January 2018 when I watched the movie Lion on Netflix. I cried my eyes out and it got me thinking that I can find online something that can help me find my family. </p>
